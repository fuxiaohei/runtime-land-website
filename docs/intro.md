# Introduction

**Runtime.land** is a tiny Function as a Service (FaaS) platform that leverages WebAssembly (Wasm) technology along with the power of [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It provides developers with a seamless and efficient environment to deploy and run their functions in a serverless architecture.

Runtime.land is deeply integrated with WebAssembly. WebAssembly (Wasm) offers significant advances in web development, including near-native performance, platform portability, language agnosticism, enhanced security through sandboxing, a growing ecosystem of tools and libraries, interoperability with many languagues, and powerful performance profiling capabilities. Wasmtime is a high-performance runtime for WebAssembly, optimized for speed and security.

Runtime.land is enabled to self-deployment on docker and k8s environments. Developers have the freedom to deploy their own instances of the platform, giving them full control over their serverless environment.
