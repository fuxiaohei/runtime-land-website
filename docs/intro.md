# Introduction

**Runtime.land** is a lightweight Function as a Service (FaaS) platform that harnesses the capabilities of WebAssembly (Wasm) technology, powered by [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). This platform offers developers a seamless and highly efficient environment to effortlessly deploy and execute their functions within a serverless architecture.

Runtime.land is deeply intertwined with WebAssembly, capitalizing on its remarkable advancements in web development. WebAssembly (Wasm) brings forth a multitude of benefits, including near-native performance, seamless portability across platforms, enhanced security through sandboxing, an expanding ecosystem of tools and libraries, interoperability with numerous languages, and robust performance profiling capabilities. Powering Runtime.land is Wasmtime, a highly performant runtime specifically designed for WebAssembly, meticulously optimized for both speed and security.

Runtime.land offers self-deployment capabilities on Docker and Kubernetes environments. Developers have the freedom to deploy and manage their own instances of the platform, providing them with complete control over their serverless environment.
