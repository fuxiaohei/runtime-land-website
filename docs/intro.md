# What is Runtime.land ?

**Runtime.land** is a tiny Function as a Service (FaaS) platform powered by [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). This platform is designed to be lightweight, fast, and secure, providing developers with a simple and efficient way to deploy their functions.

Runtime.land is a personal project of [Fuxiaohei](https://github.com/fuxiaohei) now. It's developing and not ready for business use.

## Key Features

- Build and deploy functions in any language that compiles to WebAssembly

WebAssembly is a portable, low-level bytecode that can be compiled from a variety of languages, including Rust, C/C++, Go, AssemblyScript, and many more. Runtime.land is developed in **Rust**, and is designed to support any language that compiles to WebAssembly.

- Base on serverless cloud service

Runtime.land is built on top of cloud services, and is designed to be highly scalable and cost-effective. In current stage, Runtime.land is deployed on [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/) and Cloudflare R2. It will support more cloud services in the future.
