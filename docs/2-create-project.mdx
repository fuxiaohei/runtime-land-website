# Create Project

`land-cli` is a command line tool to help you create your project. You can read [install-land-cli](/docs/get-started#step-3-install-land-cli) section in *Get Started*.

### Preperations

Before creating a project, you need to prepare the following things:

1. Install Rust and Cargo. You can follow the instructions in [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Install `wasm32-wasi` target. You can run `rustup target add wasm32-wasi` to install it.

### Create a local project

After installing `land-cli`, you can create a project by running:

```bash
land-cli init hello-world
```

It will create a project named `hello-world` in current directory with basic **Rust** template. Then you can build and run the project locally by running:

```bash
cd hello-world
land-cli build
land-cli serve
```

You can visit `http://localhost:8888` to test your project.

Next, you can read [Deploy project](/docs/deploy-project) to create and deploy your project.
