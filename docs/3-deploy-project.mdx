# Deploy Project

After creating your project, you can deploy it to Runtime.land via a deployment token you created in [Get Started](/docs/get-started#step-2-create-a-deployment-token).

## Deploy new project

Use `land-cli` to deploy your project:

```bash
land-cli deploy --token <your-token>
```

It will deploy your project to Runtime.land, and print the URL of your project. You can visit the URL to test your project.

The URL of your project looks like `https://<auto-generated-project-name>.<random-suffix>.runtime.lol`.

## Deploy to existing project

You can create empty project in [Projects](https://dash.runtime.land/projects) page.

After creating the project, you can deploy your project by running:

```bash
land-cli deploy --token <your-token> --project <your-project-name>
```

The URL of your project looks like `https://<your-project-name>.<random-suffix>.runtime.lol`.

## Production version

Runtime.land provides two versions of deployment: `dev` and `prod`. The default version is `dev`. You can deploy your project to `prod` version by running:

```bash
land-cli deploy --token <your-token> --project <your-project-name> --production
```

It will deploy your project to `prod` version with URL `https://<your-project-name>.runtime.lol`, differ from `dev` version with URL `https://<your-project-name>.<random-suffix>.runtime.lol`.
