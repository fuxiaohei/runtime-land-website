# Install land-cli

This document describes how to install the `land-cli` command line tool.

## Pre-requisites

- `land-cli` requires Rust 1.68 or later
- `rustup target add wasm32-wasi` is required to build the `land-cli` project webassembly binary
- TODO: `cargo install wizer` is required to build the `land-cli` javascript project binary

## Install

`land-cli` runs on Linux (amd64 and arm64), macOS (TODO: Intel and Apple Silicon), and Windows (TODO: amd64)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>
<p>The easiest is to use the installer script, hosted on this site:</p>

```bash
(TODO:)
curl -fsSL https://runtime.land/install-cli.sh | bash
```

It’s highly recommended to add `land-cli` to a folder, which is on your path, e.g.:

```bash
sudo mv land-cli /usr/local/bin/
```

It can install `land-cli` to your path automatically, if you have `cargo` installed.

```bash
(TODO:)
cargo install land-cli
```

After installing, you can check if it was successful by running:

```bash
land-cli --version
```

<p>The easiest is to use `brew` to install `land-cli`:</p>

```bash
(TODO:)
brew install runtime-land/tap/land-cli
```
The installer script can also be used, hosted on this site:

```bash
(TODO:)
curl -fsSL https://runtime.land/install-cli.sh | bash
```

```bash
sudo mv land-cli /usr/local/bin/

  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

If using Windows (PowerShell / cmd.exe), you can download [the Windows binary release](#install).

Unzip the archive and place the `land-cli.exe` file in your system path.

If you want to use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2), please follow the instructions for using Linux.

## Building from source

`land-cli` use grpc to communicate with the server, so you need to install the grpc dependencies:

```bash
 sudo apt install -y protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev
```

Then clone the source code and build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fuxiaohei/runtime.land
make build-cli
(TODO:)
make install-cli # optional, add land-cli to your path
```
